# /metrics - Metrics Dashboard Generator

## ⚠️ PURPOSE
Analyzes KB entries, workflow usage, and project health to generate a metrics dashboard showing learning velocity, quality indicators, and system health.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Generate dashboard
python agentic_sdlc/infrastructure/workflows/metrics.py

# Weekly report focus
python agentic_sdlc/infrastructure/workflows/metrics.py --weekly

# Sprint-specific metrics
python agentic_sdlc/infrastructure/workflows/metrics.py --sprint sprint-2

# Custom output path
python agentic_sdlc/infrastructure/workflows/metrics.py --output ./my-report.md
```

## What It Measures

### 1. Knowledge Base Metrics
- **Total KB Entries:** Count of all knowledge entries
- **This Week:** Entries added in last 7 days
- **This Month:** Entries added in last 30 days
- **Category Breakdown:** Distribution across categories

### 2. Learning Velocity
- Entries per week trend
- Strong (3+), Moderate (1-2), Low (0)

### 3. Time Saved
- Estimated hours saved per entry
- Total accumulated time saved
- Average time per entry

### 4. Quality Indicators
- Priority distribution (critical, high, medium, low)
- Category diversity
- Contributor activity

## Recommendations Engine

Auto-generates recommendations based on:
- Low documentation velocity
- Missing bug documentation
- Missing architecture decisions
- Unbalanced category distribution

## When to Run

- **Weekly:** Track learning velocity
- **End of Sprint:** Generate sprint metrics
- **Monthly:** Long-term trend analysis
- **Stakeholder Reports:** Project health overview

## Integration

- **/brain** - Uses KB data for recommendations
- **/compound** - Creates entries that affect metrics
- **/housekeeping** - References health status
- **/sprint close** - Include metrics in retrospective
