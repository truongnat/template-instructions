# 🧠 Auto-Learning System - Quick Start Guide

## What is Auto-Learning?

The auto-learning system automatically captures knowledge from every task, issue, and bug fix to build project intelligence. This creates a self-improving system that learns from experience.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Check if Learning is Required
After completing ANY task, ask yourself:

```markdown
### Auto-Learn Check
- [ ] Bug priority medium or higher?
- [ ] Required 3+ attempts?
- [ ] Same error occurred before?
- [ ] Implementation took 4+ hours?
- [ ] Security or performance issue?

**Result:** [YES/NO]
```

### Step 2: Create Knowledge Entry (if YES)
```bash
# Copy template
cp .agent/templates/Knowledge-Entry-Template.md \
   .agent/knowledge-base/[category]/[severity]/KB-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-[###]-[title].md

# Fill in the template
# Set "Auto-Generated: Yes"
# Set "Source Task: [Your Task ID]"
```

### Step 3: Sync to Neo4j Knowledge Graph
```bash
# Automatically sync your entry to Neo4j
python tools/neo4j/sync_skills_to_neo4j.py

# Verify sync and explore relationships
python tools/neo4j/query_skills_neo4j.py --all-skills
```

**What Neo4j Extracts:**
- Skills mentioned in your entry
- Technologies used
- Relationships between skills
- Learning paths and prerequisites
- Author expertise mapping

### Step 4: Update Index
Add entry to `.agent/knowledge-base/INDEX.md`:
- Update statistics
- Add to recent entries
- Add to category table
- Add to technology search
- Add to tag search

**Note:** Neo4j sync is automatic - no manual indexing needed for graph queries!

## 🎯 Role-Specific Quick Actions

### @DEV
```markdown
## After Bug Fix
1. Check severity: [critical/high/medium/low]
2. If medium+: Create KB entry
3. Document: Problem → Root Cause → Solution → Prevention
4. Tag: #bug-pattern #[technology] #auto-learned
```

### @DEVOPS
```markdown
## After Deployment Issue
1. Document: What failed → Why → How fixed
2. Create KB entry in platform-specific/
3. Add monitoring/alert recommendations
4. Tag: #deployment #infrastructure #auto-learned
```

### @TESTER
```markdown
## After Finding Edge Case
1. Document: Test scenario → Expected vs Actual → Root cause
2. Create KB entry in bugs/ or features/
3. Add regression test details
4. Tag: #testing #edge-case #auto-learned
```

### @SECA
```markdown
## After Security Issue
1. Document: Vulnerability → Impact → Fix → Prevention
2. Create KB entry in security/
3. Add detection strategy
4. Tag: #security #vulnerability #auto-learned
```

## 🔍 Search Before Starting

**ALWAYS search knowledge base before starting work:**

### Option 1: Automated Research Agent (Recommended)
```bash
# Searches both file system AND Neo4j automatically
python tools/research/research_agent.py --task "your task" --type feature

# Output includes:
# - File-based KB entries
# - Neo4j graph relationships
# - Related technologies and skills
# - Confidence level
```

### Option 2: Neo4j Graph Query
```bash
# Find skills for technology
python tools/neo4j/query_skills_neo4j.py --tech "React"

# Find related skills
python tools/neo4j/query_skills_neo4j.py --skill "Authentication"

# Search by keyword
python tools/neo4j/query_skills_neo4j.py --search "performance"
```

### Option 3: Manual File Search
```markdown
### KB Search
**Keywords:** [error message, technology, component]
**Category:** [bugs/features/architecture/security/performance]
**Results Found:** [number]

#### Relevant Entries:
1. KB-[ID]: [Title] - Relevance: [high/medium/low]
   - **Solution:** [Brief summary]
   - **Applicable:** [yes/no]

2. KB-[ID]: [Title] - Relevance: [high/medium/low]
   - **Solution:** [Brief summary]
   - **Applicable:** [yes/no]
```

**See [Research Agent Documentation](../../tools/research/README.md) for complete guide.**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Be Specific
❌ Bad: "Fixed login bug"  
✅ Good: "Fixed OAuth token refresh race condition in login flow"

### Tip 2: Include Error Messages
Always include exact error messages for searchability:
```
Error: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined
```

### Tip 3: Document Failed Attempts
Don't just document what worked - document what DIDN'T work:
```markdown
## What Didn't Work
- Tried increasing timeout → Still failed
- Tried different library → Compatibility issues
- Tried caching → Race condition persisted
```

### Tip 4: Add Visual Aids
Include screenshots, diagrams, or recordings when helpful.

### Tip 5: Cross-Reference
Link to related KB entries:
```markdown
## Related Entries
- KB-2026-01-01-001: Similar hydration issue
- KB-2025-12-15-042: SSR best practices
```
