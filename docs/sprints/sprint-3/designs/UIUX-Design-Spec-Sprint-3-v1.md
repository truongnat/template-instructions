## 🎯 Design Philosophy

**"Story-Driven, Conversion-Optimized, Trust-Building"**

Applying 2026 design trends to transform the landing page from visually stunning to conversion-optimized. Every element tells a story, builds trust, and guides users toward action.

**Core Principles (KB-2026-01-01-001):**
1. Story-driven hero sections that demonstrate value
2. Benefit-driven CTAs that inspire action
3. Real product context over abstract illustrations
4. Purposeful micro-interactions
5. Trust and accessibility by default

## 📖 Story-Driven Hero Section

### Enhanced Headline (Narrative-Focused)
```
Before: "Transform Your IDE Into a Full SDLC Team"
After: "Ship Production-Ready Apps in Days, Not Months"

Rationale: Shows outcome, not process. Time-specific benefit.
```

### Enhanced Subheadline
```
Before: "12 specialized AI roles, automated workflows"
After: "Watch AI handle planning, design, development, testing, 
       and deployment—while you focus on building great products"

Rationale: Demonstrates workflow, emphasizes user benefit.
```

### Benefit-Driven CTAs
```
Primary: "Start Building in 5 Minutes" (was "Get Started")
Secondary: "See How It Works" (was "View Demo")

Rationale: Specific time commitment + clear benefit
```
