# Project Plan: Landing Page Retrofit
**Sprint:** sprint-1
**Version:** v1.0
**Date:** 2026-01-03
**Status:** DRAFT (Waiting for Approval)

## 1. Executive Summary
This plan addresses the need to retrofit the existing `projects/landing-page` with proper SDLC documentation and compliance artifacts. The project is currently active but lacks formal planning documents, user stories, and a development log required by the `agentic-sdlc` 1.4 standards.

## 2. Methodology & Scope
- **Methodology:** Retroactive Planning & documentation.
- **In-Scope:**
    - `projects/landing-page` codebase.
    - Creation of `Project-Plan`, `User-Stories`, `Development-Log`.
- **Out-Scope:**
    - Major code refactoring (unless critical compliance issues found).
    - `projects/todo-app` (handled separately).

## 3. Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Astro (assumed based on previous logs), TailwindCSS.
- **Documentation:** Markdown in `docs/sprints/sprint-1/`.

## 4. Key Milestones & Deliverables
