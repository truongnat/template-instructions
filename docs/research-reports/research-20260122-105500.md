# Research Report: Agentic SDLC Conventions 2026
**Date:** 2026-01-22
**Category:** SDLC Standard Research
**Status:** COMPLETED

## 1. Executive Summary
This report outlines the "Next-Gen" standards for file creation, organization, and naming conventions for Agentic SDLC environments in 2026. The shift emphasizes **AI-provenance traceability**, **feature-centric modularity**, and **strict semantic naming** to facilitate both human and agent collaboration.

## 2. Naming Conventions (Unified Standards)

### 2.1 File Naming
Consistency across different operating systems and web environments is prioritized.
- **Web/TS/JS/Assets:** `kebab-case.extension` (e.g., `user-profile-service.ts`).
- **Python/Backend:** `snake_case.py` (e.g., `data_processor.py`).
- **Documentation:** `UPPER-CASE-KEBAB.md` or `Standard-Kebab.md` (e.g., `GEMINI-GUIDE.md`).
- **Templates:** `Name-Template.extension`.

### 2.2 Code Elements
- **Variables/Functions (JS/TS):** `camelCase` (e.g., `fetchUserData`).
- **Variables/Functions (Python):** `snake_case` (e.g., `process_results`).
- **Classes/Interfaces/Types:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `IUserRecord`, `AuthManager`).
- **Constants/Enums:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`).
- **React Components:** `PascalCase.tsx`.

### 2.3 Semantic Naming Rules
- **Boolean variables:** MUST use prefixes like `is`, `has`, `should`, or `can`.
- **Functions:** MUST start with a verb (e.g., `get`, `create`, `validate`).
- **Folders:** Plural nouns for collections (e.g., `utils/`, `hooks/`), singular nouns for feature domains.

## 3. Organization & Folder Structure

### 3.1 Feature/Domain-Centric Model
Move away from folder-by-type (e.g., `controllers/`, `models/`) toward folder-by-feature.
- **Root/src/features/[feature-name]/`**
  - `components/`
  - `hooks/`
  - `services/`
  - `tests/` (Co-located tests)
  - `index.ts` (Entry point/Public API)

### 3.2 Shallow Hierarchy
- **Rule of Three:** Aim for no more than 3 levels of depth below `src/`.
- Deeply nested structures increase cognitive load for both humans and agents.

### 3.3 Centralized Intelligence & Infrastructure
- **`.agent/`**: Core internal configuration and rules (FORBIDDEN for project code).
- **`tools/`**: Domain-specific scripts and CLI bridges.
- **`docs/`**: Split between Global Guides and Sprint-specific artifacts.

## 4. File Creation Rules (Agentic Standard)

In 2026, every file created by an agent MUST follow these "Provenance & Quality" rules.

### 4.1 Mandatory Header Metadata
Every source file should start with an AI-traceable header (in comments):
```javascript
/**
 * @file: [File Name]
 * @purpose: [Brief description of what this file does]
 * @module: [Module/Feature Name]
 * @author: [Agent Name] (e.g., @RESEARCH Agent)
 * @created: 2026-01-22
 * @license: MIT (or Project standard)
 * @provenance: [Prompt Hash or Task ID]
 */
```

### 4.2 Engineering Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** One file, one job. If a file exceeds 300 lines, it is a candidate for refactoring.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Extract common logic to `shared/` or `utils/` early.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Avoid over-engineering. Favor readability over cleverness.
- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Do not add "future-proof" boilerplate unless explicitly requested.

### 4.3 Integrated Quality
- **Test-First Shadowing:** When creating a code file, the agent SHOULD simultaneously outline or create its corresponding `.test.ts` or `_test.py` file.
- **Lint Compliance:** Files MUST be created in a state that passes pre-configured linting rules (ESLint, Ruff, etc.).

## 5. Synthesis & Implementation Path

### Current State vs. 2026 Standard
1. **Naming:** Current `naming-conventions.md` is 90% aligned but lacks "Boolean Prefix" and "Folder Pluralization" rules.
2. **Organization:** Current `artifacts.md` is very strong on documentation but lacks a strict "Feature-Centric" rule for source code.
3. **File Creation:** No existing rule for "AI Metadata Headers".

### Recommendations
- **Update `.agent/rules/naming-conventions.md`** to include semantic naming (Boolean prefixes, verb-first functions).
- **Create `.agent/rules/structure.md`** to define the Feature-Centric and Shallow Hierarchy rules.
- **Update `.agent/rules/code-quality.md`** to include mandatory metadata headers and SRP line-count limits.
