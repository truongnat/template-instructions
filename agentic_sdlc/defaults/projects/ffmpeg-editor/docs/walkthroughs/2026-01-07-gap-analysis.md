# Walkthrough - Feature Gap Analysis

> **Date:** 2026-01-07  
> **Task:** Brain Feature Scan and Gap Analysis  
> **Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary

Conducted a comprehensive feature scan of the FFmpeg Desktop Editor to identify gaps and plan improvements for future sprints. This was a planning-only task with no implementation.

## What Was Done

### 1. Project Scan
- Analyzed all source files in `src/` (10 components, 2 hooks, 1 type file)
- Reviewed Rust backend (`lib.rs` - 533 lines)
- Checked existing documentation and sprint plans
- Reviewed kanban board status

### 2. Feature Inventory
Documented **20+ fully implemented features** across categories:
- Core: Format conversion, trimming, playback
- Filters: Brightness, contrast, saturation, blur, sharpen
- Overlays: Text watermarks, image logos
- Audio: Volume, speed, extraction
- Export: Scaling, presets, GIF, thumbnails
- Batch & Merge: Queue processing, multi-file merge

### 3. Gap Identification
Identified **10 feature gaps** with detailed analysis:
| Priority | Gap |
|----------|-----|
| P1 | Real-Time Filter Preview |
| P2 | Visual Frame Selector |
| P2 | Undo/Redo System |
| P2 | Keyboard Shortcuts |
| P2 | Drag-and-Drop Support |
| P2 | Enhanced Error Feedback |
| P3 | Project Files (Save/Load) |
| P3 | Multi-Track Timeline |
| P3 | User Export Presets |
| P3 | Waveform Display |

### 4. Sprint Roadmap
Proposed structured implementation across 3 sprints:
- **Sprint 4:** UX Polish (11h) - Shortcuts, DnD, Frame Selector, Errors
- **Sprint 5:** Advanced Preview (16h) - Preview, Undo/Redo, Waveform
- **Sprint 6:** Workflow (9h) - Project files, Export presets

### 5. Artifacts Created
- [Gap Analysis](file:///d:/dev/agentic-sdlc/projects/ffmpeg-editor/docs/sprints/sprint-4/gap-analysis.md) - Comprehensive planning document
- Updated [Kanban Board](file:///d:/dev/agentic-sdlc/projects/ffmpeg-editor/docs/kanban/board.md) with 12 new tasks

## Verification

- [x] All features inventoried
- [x] Gaps documented with priority levels
- [x] Proposed solutions include component names and complexity
- [x] Sprint roadmap with hour estimates
- [x] Artifacts persisted to project docs
- [x] Kanban board updated
