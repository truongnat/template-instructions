> Transform your IDE into a complete Software Development Lifecycle team with AI-powered agents, automated workflows, and intelligent knowledge management.

## 🎯 What is Agentic SDLC?

**Agentic SDLC** is an AI-powered development framework that simulates a complete software development team within your IDE. It provides:

- **17 Specialized AI Roles** - PM, BA, SA, UI/UX, QA, Security, Dev, DevOps, Tester, Reporter, and more
- **23 Automated Workflows** - From planning to deployment with `/slash` commands
- **Reinforced Brain System** - 21 Intelligence sub-agents including HITL, Sandbox, and Self-Healing
- **Multi-Agent Teams** - AutoGen-powered autonomous agent collaboration
- **Cross-IDE Compatibility** - Works with Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Aider, Gemini, and any AI-powered IDE
- **Monorepo Architecture** - Shared brain system across multiple projects

## 🏗️ Architecture & Flows

### 3-Layer Concentric Architecture

The system is built on a robust 3-layer architecture where dependencies flow inward (Layer 3 → Layer 2 → Layer 1):

![3-Layer Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/truongnat/agentic-sdlc/main/docs/diagrams/architecture_3_layers.png)

**Layer 1 (Core)** - The stable foundation that rarely changes:
- GEMINI.md - Universal guide and single source of truth
- Skills - 17 AI role definitions
- Templates - 20+ document templates
- Rules - 8 rule files for enforcement
- Workflows - 23 workflow definitions

**Layer 2 (Intelligence)** - The brain system with 21 sub-agents:
- **Monitoring & Compliance**: Observer, Monitor, Workflow Validator
- **Quality & Scoring**: Judge, Scorer, Evaluation
- **Learning & Optimization**: Self-Learning, DSPy, A/B Test
- **Execution & Safety**: HITL, Sandbox, Self-Healing
- **Intelligence & Routing**: Proxy, Router, Task Manager, Research
- **Generation & Tracking**: Artifact Gen, Cost, Performance

**Layer 3 (Infrastructure)** - External interfaces and tools:
- CLI, MCP Connectors, GitHub Integration
- Neo4j Knowledge Graph, Documentation
- Workflow Scripts, Communication Tools

### Orchestrator Workflow with HITL Gates

The orchestrator workflow manages the complete SDLC lifecycle with mandatory human approval gates:

![Orchestrator Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/truongnat/agentic-sdlc/main/docs/diagrams/orchestrator_workflow_flow.png)

**Key Features:**
- **11 Phases**: From Planning to Self-Learning
- **3 HITL Gates**: Design Approval, Code Review, Deployment Approval
- **4 Checkpoints**: State persistence at critical phases
- **Self-Healing Loop**: Automatic fix/retry on test failures
- **Brain Status Checks**: Validation at start and end

**Flow:**
1. **Planning** (@PM) → Create project plan
2. **Requirements** (@BA) → Define user stories
3. **Design** (@SA + @UIUX) → Architecture & UI/UX specs
4. 🛑 **HITL Gate 1** → Human approval required
5. **Verification** (@TESTER + @SECA) → Quality & security review
6. **Development** (@DEV + @DEVOPS) → Feature implementation
7. 🛑 **HITL Gate 2** → Code review & PR approval
8. **Testing** (@TESTER) → E2E testing with self-healing
9. **Bug Fixing** (@DEV) → Issue resolution
10. **Deployment** (@DEVOPS) → Production deployment
11. 🛑 **HITL Gate 3** → Production approval
12. **Reporting** (@PM) → CHANGELOG & review
13. **Self-Learning** (@BRAIN) → KB sync & archive

### Brain Intelligence Sub-Agents Network

The brain system consists of 21 specialized sub-agents working in harmony:

![Brain Intelligence Sub-Agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/truongnat/agentic-sdlc/main/docs/diagrams/brain_intelligence_subagents.png)

**Data Flow Patterns:**
- **Compliance Feedback Loop**: Observer → Judge → Self-Learning
- **Quality Improvement Loop**: A/B Test → Judge → Self-Learning
- **Persistence**: All agents → State Manager
- **Learning**: All agents → Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)
- **Approval Gates**: HITL ↔ Critical phases
- **Auto-Fix**: Self-Healing ↔ Testing
- **Model Routing**: Proxy → All agents
- **Cost Tracking**: Cost → All agents

### Brain Learning Loop

Every task execution improves the system through compound learning:

![Brain Learning Loop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/truongnat/agentic-sdlc/main/docs/diagrams/brain_learning_loop.png)

**8-Step Learning Cycle:**
1. **Execute Task** - Any SDLC phase
2. **Observer Monitors** - Track actions & violations
3. **Judge Scores** - Quality assessment (0-100)
4. **A/B Testing** - Generate alternatives
5. **Self-Learning** - Extract patterns:
   - Observer violations → New rules
   - Judge scores → Quality patterns
   - A/B results → Best solutions
   - Completed tasks → Reusable solutions
   - Fixed bugs → Anti-patterns
6. **Knowledge Storage** - Neo4j Graph + SQLite State + LEANN Vector Search
7. **Context-Aware Suggestions** - Smart recommendations
8. **DSPy Optimization** - Improve prompts

**Side Flows:**
- **Error Path**: Self-Healing → Fix → Back to execution
- **Cost Path**: Cost Monitor → Budget alerts
- **State Path**: State Manager → Checkpoints

### SDLC State Machine

Complete state machine showing all transitions and error handling:

![SDLC State Machine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/truongnat/agentic-sdlc/main/docs/diagrams/sdlc_state_machine.png)

**States & Transitions:**
- **IDLE** → `brain init` → **PLANNING**
- **PLANNING** (@PM, @BA, @PO) → User Approval → **DESIGN**
- **DESIGN** (@SA, @UIUX) → HITL Approval → **VERIFICATION**
- **VERIFICATION** (@TESTER, @SECA) → Passed → **DEVELOPMENT**
- **DEVELOPMENT** (@DEV, @DEVOPS) → HITL Code Review → **TESTING**
- **TESTING** (@TESTER) → Tests Passed → **DEPLOYMENT**
  - Tests Failed → Self-Healing → Back to **DEVELOPMENT**
- **DEPLOYMENT** (@DEVOPS) → HITL Production Approval → **REPORTING**
- **REPORTING** (@PM, @REPORTER) → Complete → **LEARNING**
- **LEARNING** (@BRAIN) → Done → **IDLE**

**Error Handling:**
- Any State → ERROR → HALTED
- HALTED → Fix Issue → Resume → Previous State

**Checkpoints:**
- Planning, Design, Development, Deployment

## 🧠 The Brain System

At the core of Agentic SDLC is the **Brain** - an intelligent knowledge management system that:

- **Learns from every task** - Automatically captures patterns from bugs, features, and solutions
- **Provides recommendations** - Suggests approaches based on past successes
- **Builds knowledge graphs** - Maps relationships between skills, technologies, and solutions
- **Enables compound intelligence** - Each project's knowledge benefits all others
