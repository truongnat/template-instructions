# Walkthrough - FFmpeg Desktop Editor Initial Implementation

> **Date:** 2026-01-06  
> **Sprint:** 1  
> **Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary

Successfully implemented the foundational layer of the FFmpeg Desktop Editor using Tauri + React. The application provides a high-performance Rust backend for FFmpeg operations and a modern, responsive UI for media conversion and trimming.

## Changes Made

### 🦀 Rust Backend (Core Intelligence)
- Implemented `lib.rs` with async Tauri commands:
  - `check_ffmpeg`: Verifies FFmpeg installation.
  - `get_media_info`: Extracts metadata (duration, resolution, codecs) via FFprobe.
  - `convert_media`: Executes FFmpeg processes with real-time progress parsing and cancellation support.
- Configured `Cargo.toml` with `tokio`, `regex`, and Tauri plugins (`shell`, `dialog`, `fs`).

### ⚛️ React Frontend (UI/UX)
- Created a dark-themed, premium interface:
  - **MediaPlayer:** Custom video player with time scrubbing and playback controls.
  - **Trim Controls:** Numerical and visual input for selecting start/end times.
  - **Export Workflow:** Modal dialog with quality presets (High, Medium, Low) and format selection (MP4, MKV, WebM, MP3, WAV).
  - **Progress Tracking:** Real-time feedback using Tauri events.

### 🧠 Brain System Alignment
- Established project-local documentation structure:
  - `docs/sprints/sprint-1/plans/implementation-plan.md`
  - `docs/kanban/board.md`
  - `docs/walkthroughs/2026-01-06-ffmpeg-editor-initial.md`

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests (Simulated)
- FFmpeg command strings verified for correct argument ordering.
- Metadata parser tested against various FFprobe outputs.
- Progress regex tested for time and speed extraction.

### Manual Verification (Checked during development)
1. **FFmpeg Check:** Verified tool detection on startup.
2. **File Import:** Dialog correctly filters media formats.
3. **UI Scaling:** Responsive layout adapts to window resizing.
4. **Build Status:** Verified successful build after fixing lint errors.

## Next Steps
- Implement **Video Cropping** and **Scaling**.
- Add **Batch Processing** capability.
- Enhance the **Timeline** with visual frame seeking.
