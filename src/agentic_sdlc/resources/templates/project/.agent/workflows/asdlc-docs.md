1. Ask the user which component needs documentation (e.g., API docs, README update, code comments, user guides).

2. Run the following command to generate the required documentation:
```bash
asdlc run "Generate comprehensive documentation for: {{target}}. Ensure it aligns with the project's existing format and structure."
```

3. Follow the output instructions to either update existing markdown files or write new ones. Ensure technical accuracy and readability.
