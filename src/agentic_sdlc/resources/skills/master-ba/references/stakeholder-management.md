# Stakeholder Management Standards

## Identifying Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Direct users of the system.
- **Secondary**: Managers, admins, or support staff.
- **Tertiary**: IT Ops, Security, Compliance, or Legal.

## Communication Matrix
Define who needs to know what and how often.

| Stakeholder | Interest | Influence | Communication Frequency |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Project Sponsor** | High | High | Weekly Briefings |
| **Dev Team** | High | Medium | Daily Standups |
| **End Users** | High | Low | Monthly Feedback / Beta tests |
| **Security Team** | Medium | High | Quarterly Audits / Design Reviews |

## Conflict Resolution
- **Prioritization**: Use MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) to resolve scope conflicts.
- **Evidence-Based Refinement**: Use data and usage metrics to justify decisions when stakeholders disagree.
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Explicitly document the "Cost of Delay" for requested features.

## Feedback Loops
- **Showcases/Demos**: Regular sessions to show progress and gather immediate course-correction feedback.
- **Surveys**: For large user bases to gather quantitative sentiment.
- **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)**: The final verification that the business value has been delivered.
