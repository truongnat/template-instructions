name: project-standards
description: Establish and define global, project-agnostic coding rules, architectural constraints, and standards for a new or existing codebase.

role: architect
category: general
tags:
  - architecture
  - standards
  - guidelines
  - adr

steps:
  - name: analyze-context
    action: analyze_project_context
    description: Scan the current repository to understand the primary language, framework, and existing patterns. Identify any existing `.cursorrules` or `CONTEXT.md`.
    expected_output: Context summary report.

  - name: define-tech-stack
    action: define_technology_stack
    description: Clearly define the technology stack, language versions, and allowed libraries based on the context. Set hard rules about what is NOT allowed.
    expected_output: Tech stack rules.

  - name: define-architecture-rules
    action: define_architectural_rules
    description: Establish the project structure (folder hierarchy), component design patterns (e.g., MVC, Clean Architecture, component scoped CSS), and data flow rules.
    expected_output: Architectural guidelines.

  - name: define-agent-rules
    action: define_ai_agent_rules
    description: Define specific rules that AI agents (Developer, Reviewer, Tester) must follow when modifying this codebase to prevent AI-generated technical debt.
    expected_output: AI Swarm interaction rules.

  - name: generate-standard-adr
    action: write_architecture_decision_record
    description: Compile all defined rules into a standard, formal Architectural Decision Record (ADR) and save it in the `docs/architecture/` directory.
    expected_output: Complete ADR markdown file defining project standards.

validation_rules:
  - ADR must be saved to docs/architecture/
  - Must explicitly state rules for AI agents modifying the code.
  - Must clearly define allowed and forbidden technologies/patterns.

scoring_criteria:
  clarity:
    weight: 0.3
    description: Rules must be unambiguous and actionable.
  comprehensiveness:
    weight: 0.3
    description: Covers tech stack, architecture, and AI interaction.
  project_alignment:
    weight: 0.4
    description: Standards make logical sense for the detected framework/language.
