# GEMINI.md - Brain System Documentation

> **⚠️ MANDATORY COMPLIANCE:** This document contains RULES that MUST be followed for ALL tasks. Non-compliance is NOT acceptable.

---

## 🚨 MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT RULES

> [!CAUTION]
> **THESE RULES ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Before executing ANY task, you MUST complete the pre-flight checklist below.

### Pre-Flight Checklist (REQUIRED for ALL Tasks)

Before starting ANY work, complete these steps IN ORDER:

1. **READ THE WORKFLOW FILE** - If user mentions `/slash`, read `.agent/workflows/[slash].md` FIRST
2. **SEARCH KNOWLEDGE BASE** - Check `.agent/knowledge-base/INDEX.md` for relevant prior solutions
3. **IDENTIFY ROLES** - Determine which `@ROLE` agents should be activated
4. **INITIALIZE STATE** - Run `python tools/brain/brain_cli.py status` to check current state
5. **ANNOUNCE START** - Log the task start (conceptually, no actual command needed)

### Slash Command Interpretation

When user types a slash command, you MUST:

| User Input | REQUIRED Action |
|------------|-----------------|
| `/auto` or `/orchestrator` | Read `.agent/workflows/orchestrator.md` and follow ALL phases |
| `/cycle` | Read `.agent/workflows/cycle.md` and follow ALL steps |
| `/brain` | Read `.agent/workflows/brain.md` and execute commands |
| `/explore` | Read `.agent/workflows/explore.md` for deep investigation |
| `/sprint` | Read `.agent/workflows/sprint.md` for sprint management |
| `/emergency` | Read `.agent/workflows/emergency.md` for hotfix |
| Any `/command` | Read `.agent/workflows/[command].md` BEFORE doing anything |

### Role Activation Matrix

For ANY task, activate the appropriate roles based on task type:

| Task Type | Required Roles | Workflow |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| New Feature/Project | @PM → @SA → @UIUX → @DEV → @TESTER | `/orchestrator` |
| Bug Fix | @DEV → @TESTER | `/cycle` |
| Investigation | @SA → @DEV | `/explore` |
| Hotfix/Emergency | @DEV → @DEVOPS | `/emergency` |
| Documentation | @PM → @REPORTER | `/cycle` |

### Compliance Gates (MANDATORY)

1. **Planning Gate** - For features/projects, create Project Plan BEFORE implementing
2. **Design Gate** - For complex tasks, create design spec BEFORE coding
3. **Review Gate** - All code must have conceptual @TESTER review
4. **Learning Gate** - After completion, document learnings to KB

### Self-Learning Protocol (REQUIRED After Every Task)

After completing ANY task:

```bash
# Record success pattern (conceptual - describe what was learned)
# Update knowledge base if solution was non-obvious
# Consider what should be documented for future reference
```

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES** means the brain system is not being used correctly. If you find yourself implementing without reading workflows, STOP and restart with the pre-flight checklist.

### 📦 Artifact Persistence Rule (MANDATORY)

> [!CAUTION]
> **ALL task results, reports, and IDE-generated artifacts MUST be persisted to docs and synced to Neo4j.**

After completing ANY task:

1. **Save artifacts to project docs:**
   ```bash
   # Implementation plans → docs/sprints/sprint-[N]/plans/
   # Walkthroughs → docs/walkthroughs/
   # Reports → docs/reports/
   # Analysis → docs/artifacts/
   ```

2. **Sync to Neo4j:**
   ```bash
   agentic-sdlc kb compound sync
   ```

3. **Record in learning engine:**
   ```bash
   agentic-sdlc learn --record-success "[task-id]" --task-type "[type]"
   ```

| Artifact Type | Save Location | Neo4j Sync |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Implementation plans | `docs/sprints/sprint-[N]/plans/` | ✅ |
| Walkthroughs | `docs/walkthroughs/` | ✅ |
| Analysis reports | `docs/reports/` | ✅ |
| IDE artifacts | `docs/artifacts/` | ✅ |
| **Solutions** | `docs/solutions/` | ✅ |
| Bug fixes | `.agent/knowledge-base/bugs/` | ✅ |
| Feature docs | `.agent/knowledge-base/features/` | ✅ |

**Enforcement:**
- ❌ No silent completion - every task produces a persisted artifact
- ❌ No orphan artifacts - IDE artifacts MUST be copied to project docs
- ❌ No unsynced knowledge - all learnings MUST sync to Neo4j

## 🧠 What is the Brain System?

The **Brain** is the core of Agentic SDLC - an intelligent, self-learning knowledge management system located in the `.agent/` directory. It provides:

1. **3-Layer Architecture** - Root (Brain), Workflow, Execution layers
2. **AI Role System** - 14 specialized agents (PM, BA, SA, Dev, QA, etc.)
3. **Workflow Automation** - 12 predefined workflows accessible via `/slash` commands
4. **Knowledge Base** - Compound learning from every task, bug, and solution
5. **Cross-IDE Compatibility** - Works with any IDE through standard markdown files
6. **Self-Learning Engine** - Automatically improves from project experience

# Use brain system
python tools/neo4j/brain_parallel.py --recommend "OAuth implementation"
```

---

## 🧠 Brain Intelligence System

The brain consists of **three interconnected layers:**

### Layer 1: LEANN (Vector Search)

**What:** High-performance vector database for semantic search
**Location:** `.leann/` directory (auto-generated)

```bash
# Index project
leann index --path .

# Update index
leann index --update

# Search (used by Research Agent)
leann search "authentication patterns"
```

### Layer 2: Neo4j (Knowledge Graph)

**What:** Graph database mapping skills, technologies, and relationships
**Location:** Cloud-hosted (configured in `.env`)

**Capabilities:**
- Visualize skill relationships
- Find learning paths
- Discover related technologies
- Track team expertise
- Reason about solutions

**Configuration (`.env`):**

```bash
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
```

**Usage:**

```bash
# Sync KB to Neo4j
python tools/neo4j/sync_skills_to_neo4j.py

# Sync documents (plans, reports, artifacts)
python tools/neo4j/document_sync.py --all

# Query skills
python tools/neo4j/query_skills_neo4j.py --all-skills

# Get learning path
python tools/neo4j/query_skills_neo4j.py --learning-path "Authentication"
```

### Layer 3: File-based KB

**What:** Human-readable markdown files with YAML metadata
**Location:** `.agent/knowledge-base/`

**Advantages:**
- Git-trackable
- Easily editable
- No database required
- Works offline

### Brain Workflows (Parallel Execution)

**Quick Sync (Recommended):**

```bash
# Sync all brain systems in parallel
python tools/neo4j/brain_parallel.py --sync
```

**Full Operations:**

```bash
# Complete sync (LEANN + Neo4j + Learning Engine)
python tools/neo4j/brain_parallel.py --full

# Get statistics
python tools/neo4j/brain_parallel.py --stats

# Get recommendations
python tools/neo4j/brain_parallel.py --recommend "implement caching"
```

**Self-Learning Commands:**

```bash
# Record error pattern
python tools/neo4j/learning_engine.py --record-error "TypeError" \
  "Cannot read property X of undefined" \
  --resolution "Added null check" \
  --approach "defensive_coding"

# Record success pattern
python tools/neo4j/learning_engine.py --record-success "task-123" \
  --task-type "auth_feature" \
  --success-approach "JWT with refresh tokens"

# Find similar errors
python tools/neo4j/learning_engine.py --similar-errors "ConnectionError"

# Get recommendations
python tools/neo4j/learning_engine.py --recommend \
  "implement user authentication"
```

**Statistics & Insights:**

```bash
# Learning statistics
python tools/neo4j/learning_engine.py --stats

# View learned patterns
python tools/neo4j/learning_engine.py --patterns

# View reasoning paths
python tools/neo4j/learning_engine.py --reasoning-path "TypeError" "null check"
```

---

## 🔄 Self-Learning Triggers

The brain **automatically learns** when these events occur:

| Trigger | What Gets Learned |
|---------|-------------------|
| Bug fixed (medium+ priority) | Error pattern, resolution, similar issues |
| Task required 3+ attempts | Complexity patterns, better approaches |
| Same error occurred 2+ times | Root cause, prevention strategy |
| Complex feature completed (4+ hours) | Implementation approach, best practices |
| Security/performance issue resolved | Vulnerability patterns, optimization techniques |

**How it works:**

1. **Detection** - Agent detects qualifying event
2. **Capture** - Automatically extracts:
   - Problem description
   - Solution approach
   - Code patterns
   - Related technologies
3. **Storage** - Saves to:
   - File-based KB (`.agent/knowledge-base/`)
   - Neo4j graph (relationships)
   - LEANN index (semantic search)
4. **Indexing** - Updates:
   - KB INDEX.md
   - Neo4j relationships
   - LEANN vectors
5. **Future Use** - Available for:
   - Recommendations
   - Similar problem detection
   - Learning path suggestions

## 💡 Advanced Usage

### Research Agent Integration

The Research Agent automatically queries the brain when researching:

```bash
python tools/research/research_agent.py \
  --task "authentication" \
  --type feature

# Output includes:
# - LEANN semantic search results
# - Neo4j graph relationships
# - File-based KB entries
# - Confidence level
```

### Custom Workflows

Create your own workflows in `.agent/workflows/`:

```markdown
---
description: My Custom Workflow
---

# Custom Workflow

## Step 1: [Action]
[Instructions]

## Step 2: [Action]
[Instructions]

#custom #workflow
```

### Knowledge Base Search

```bash
# CLI search
python bin/kb_cli.py search "authentication"

# In IDE
/kb-search authentication

# Advanced search
python bin/kb_cli.py search "JWT" --category security --tags oauth
```

### Compound Learning

**Concept:** Knowledge from one project benefits all projects in the monorepo.

**How it works:**
1. Project A solves OAuth authentication
2. Knowledge saved to `.agent/knowledge-base/`
3. Project B needs authentication
4. Brain recommends OAuth approach from Project A
5. Project B adapts and improves solution
6. Updated knowledge benefits Projects C, D, E...

```bash
# Trigger compound learning
python tools/neo4j/brain_parallel.py --full

# View cross-project knowledge
python bin/kb_cli.py list --all-projects
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use this without Neo4j?**
A: Yes! The file-based KB and LEANN work independently. Neo4j adds graph intelligence but is optional.

**Q: Does this work offline?**
A: Partially. File-based KB and LEANN work offline. Neo4j requires internet connection.

**Q: Can I customize workflows?**
A: Absolutely! Add your own workflows to `.agent/workflows/` following the existing format.

**Q: How do I share knowledge with my team?**
A: Commit `.agent/knowledge-base/` to Git. Team members sync brain after pulling.

**Q: What if my IDE isn't supported?**
A: All IDEs can reference `.agent/` files. Create custom integration or use CLI tools.

**Q: How do I migrate from another system?**
A: Run `agentic-sdlc install` in your project. It preserves existing code and adds the brain system.
