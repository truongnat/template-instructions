# Knowledge Base Scripts

**Cross-Platform CLI** - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

PowerShell scripts and Python-based CLI for managing the TeamLifecycle knowledge base with Neo4j brain integration.

## 🌍 Cross-Platform Support

The KB CLI now supports all major platforms:

- **Windows** - CMD, PowerShell, Git Bash
- **Linux** - Bash, Zsh, Fish
- **macOS** - Bash, Zsh

### Quick Start

**Windows:**
```cmd
bin\kb.bat help
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./bin/kb help
```

**See:** `CROSS-PLATFORM-CLI.md` for complete cross-platform guide

## Overview

The compound learning system combines file-based storage with Neo4j graph database to create an intelligent knowledge system:

- **File System** - Stores full markdown content from `.agent/knowledge-base/` and `docs/`
- **Neo4j Brain** - Maps relationships between skills, technologies, and entries
- **Compound Scripts** - Seamless integration between both
- **Cross-Platform** - Python-based CLI works everywhere
- **Unified Search** - Search across KB entries + all project documentation (46+ entries)

### Knowledge Sources

The system indexes knowledge from two locations:

1. **`.agent/knowledge-base/`** - KB entries (bugs, features, architecture)
2. **`docs/`** - All project documentation (guides, reports, architecture docs)

This provides **7x more searchable knowledge** than KB entries alone!

## Available Scripts

### Cross-Platform CLI

**Entry Points:**
- `kb` - Bash script (Linux/macOS/Git Bash)
- `kb.bat` - Windows batch script
- `kb_cli.py` - Python CLI (all platforms)

**Library Modules:**
- `lib/kb_common.py` - Common utilities

## 📚 Available Scripts

### 1. `kb` / `kb.bat` - Main Interface
Central command-line interface for all KB operations.

**Windows:**
```cmd
bin\kb.bat [command] [args]
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./bin/kb [command] [args]
```

## 🔍 Commands

### 1. Search Knowledge Base

Search for entries by keyword:

```powershell

.\bin\kb.ps1 search "react hydration"

# Search in specific category
.\bin\kb-search.ps1 "oauth" -Category "features"

# Filter by priority
.\bin\kb-search.ps1 "bug" -Priority "critical"
```

**What it does:**
- Searches INDEX.md first
- Then searches all KB entry files
- Shows matching entries with context
- Displays file paths and metadata

### 2. Add New Entry

Interactive wizard to create a new KB entry:

```powershell
.\bin\kb.ps1 add
```

**What it does:**
- Prompts for title, category, priority, tags
- Generates unique filename with date and ID

# Show last 5 entries
.\bin\kb.ps1 recent 5
```

### 7. Compound Mode (Neo4j Integration)

Enhanced commands that integrate file system with Neo4j brain:

```powershell
# Compound search (file + Neo4j)
.\bin\kb.ps1 compound search "authentication"

# Compound add (create + sync to Neo4j)
.\bin\kb.ps1 compound add

# Compound sync (full sync to Neo4j)
.\bin\kb.ps1 compound sync

# Compound query (intelligent Neo4j queries)
.\bin\kb.ps1 compound query "React"

# Compound stats (system health)
.\bin\kb.ps1 compound stats
```

**What compound mode does:**
- Searches both file system AND Neo4j graph
- Automatically syncs entries to Neo4j brain
- Maps relationships between skills and technologies
- Provides intelligent contextual queries
- Shows compound system health
