## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Start a Project

Invoke **PM** to begin planning:

```
@PM - I want to build a wedding website with:
- Couple introduction page
- Countdown timer
- Photo gallery
- RSVP form
```

PM will create `Project-Plan-v1.md` and wait for your approval.

### Step 2: Approval

After reviewing the plan, respond with:
- ✅ **"Approved"** - Proceed to next phase
- 🔄 **Provide feedback** - PM will revise and create a new version

### Step 3: Automatic Workflow

Once approved, roles are triggered automatically in sequence:

```
PM → SA + UIUX + PO → QA + SecA → DEV + DevOps → TESTER → REPORTER → STAKEHOLDER
```

## ⚠️ Important Rules

### ✅ DO:
- Start with `@PM` for new projects
- Provide clear approval before phase transitions
- Use correct tags to invoke roles
- Review generated artifacts

### ❌ DON'T:
- Skip phases (e.g., coding before design approval)
- Add features not in approved plan
- Bypass security review

## 🔄 Changing Scope

1. Invoke `@PM` with change request

4. Continue workflow
