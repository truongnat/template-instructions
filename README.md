# Agentic SDLC

> Transform your IDE into a complete Software Development Lifecycle team with AI-powered agents, automated workflows, and intelligent knowledge management.

## 🎯 What is Agentic SDLC?

**Agentic SDLC** is an AI-powered development framework that simulates a complete software development team within your IDE. It provides:

- **14 Specialized AI Roles** - PM, BA, SA, UI/UX, QA, Security, Dev, DevOps, Tester, Reporter, and more
- **18 Automated Workflows** - From planning to deployment with `/slash` commands
- **Intelligent Brain System** - 3-Layer architecture with state management and self-learning
- **Multi-Agent Teams** - AutoGen-powered autonomous agent collaboration
- **Cross-IDE Compatibility** - Works with Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Aider, Gemini, and any AI-powered IDE
- **Monorepo Architecture** - Shared brain system across multiple projects

## 🧠 The Brain System

At the core of Agentic SDLC is the **Brain** - an intelligent knowledge management system that:

- **Learns from every task** - Automatically captures patterns from bugs, features, and solutions
- **Provides recommendations** - Suggests approaches based on past successes
- **Builds knowledge graphs** - Maps relationships between skills, technologies, and solutions
- **Enables compound intelligence** - Each project's knowledge benefits all others

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. AI Role System (14 Roles)

Specialized AI agents for every SDLC phase:

```
Planning    → @PM, @BA, @PO
Design      → @SA, @UIUX
Review      → @QA, @SECA
Development → @DEV, @DEVOPS
Testing     → @TESTER
Delivery    → @REPORTER, @STAKEHOLDER
Meta        → @BRAIN, @ORCHESTRATOR
```

### 2. Slash Commands (18 Workflows)

Execute complete workflows with simple commands:

```bash
/brain           # Brain system management (sync, stats)
/cycle           # Complete task lifecycle
/explore         # Deep investigation
/orchestrator    # Full SDLC automation
/sprint          # Sprint management
/validate        # System validation
/metrics         # View metrics dashboard
/release         # Release management
/emergency       # Critical incident response
/housekeeping    # Cleanup & maintenance
/review          # Code review workflow (NEW)
/debug           # Systematic debugging (NEW)
/refactor        # Safe refactoring (NEW)
/onboarding      # Agent ramp-up (NEW)
/docs            # Documentation creation (NEW)
/commit          # Smart git commit (NEW)
/worktree        # Parallel AI agent workflows (NEW)
/autogen         # Multi-agent task execution (NEW)
```

### 3. Monorepo Architecture

```
agentic-sdlc/              # 🧠 Brain (Root)
├── .agent/                # AI workflows, skills, KB
├── tools/                 # Neo4j, research, utilities
├── docs/                  # Documentation
└── projects/              # Your projects

```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Shared brain across all projects
- ✅ Compound learning from every solution
- ✅ Consistent workflows and quality
- ✅ Centralized knowledge management

### 4. Knowledge Management

**Automated Learning:**
- Records error patterns and solutions
- Captures successful implementation approaches
- Builds skill and technology graphs
- Provides context-aware recommendations

**Three-Layer System:**
1. **LEANN** - Vector-based semantic search
2. **Neo4j** - Knowledge graph with relationships
3. **File-based KB** - Categorized markdown entries
