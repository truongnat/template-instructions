# Agentic SDLC

> Transform your IDE into a complete Software Development Lifecycle team with AI-powered agents, automated workflows, and intelligent knowledge management.

## 🎯 What is Agentic SDLC?

**Agentic SDLC** is an AI-powered development framework that simulates a complete software development team within your IDE. It provides:

- **13+ Specialized AI Roles** - PM, SA, UI/UX, QA, Security, Dev, DevOps, Tester, Reporter, and more
- **32+ Automated Workflows** - From planning to deployment with `/slash` commands
- **Intelligent Brain System** - LEANN + Neo4j for compound learning and knowledge graphs
- **Cross-IDE Compatibility** - Works with Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Aider, and any AI-powered IDE
- **Monorepo Architecture** - Shared brain system across multiple projects

## 🧠 The Brain System

At the core of Agentic SDLC is the **Brain** - an intelligent knowledge management system that:

- **Learns from every task** - Automatically captures patterns from bugs, features, and solutions
- **Provides recommendations** - Suggests approaches based on past successes
- **Builds knowledge graphs** - Maps relationships between skills, technologies, and solutions
- **Enables compound intelligence** - Each project's knowledge benefits all others

## ✨ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g agentic-sdlc

# Or with bun
bun install -g agentic-sdlc
```

### Create New Project

```bash
# Create project with brain system
agentic-sdlc create my-project
cd my-project

# Setup your IDE
agentic-sdlc ide cursor  # or windsurf, cline, etc.

# Start building
/pm Build a todo app with authentication
```

### Add to Existing Project

```bash
# Install brain system in current directory
agentic-sdlc install

# Setup IDE integration
agentic-sdlc ide cursor

# Initialize knowledge base
agentic-sdlc init-kb
```

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. AI Role System (13+ Roles)

Specialized AI agents for every SDLC phase:

```
Planning    → @PM, @BA, @PO
Design      → @SA, @UIUX
Review      → @QA, @SECA
Development → @DEV, @DEVOPS
Testing     → @TESTER
Delivery    → @REPORTER, @STAKEHOLDER
Automation  → @ORCHESTRATOR, @AUTO
```

### 2. Slash Commands (32+ Workflows)

Execute complete workflows with simple commands:

```bash
/pm              # Project planning
/auto            # Full automation
/cycle           # Complete task lifecycle
/dev             # Development workflow
/qa              # Quality assurance
/brain           # Brain system management
/kb-search       # Search knowledge base
```

### 3. Monorepo Architecture

```
agentic-sdlc/              # 🧠 Brain (Root)
├── .agent/                # AI workflows, roles, KB
├── tools/                 # Neo4j, research, utilities
├── docs/                  # Documentation
└── projects/              # Your projects
    ├── project-1/
    ├── project-2/
    └── [add-yours]/
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Shared brain across all projects
- ✅ Compound learning from every solution
- ✅ Consistent workflows and quality
- ✅ Centralized knowledge management

### 4. Knowledge Management

**Automated Learning:**
- Records error patterns and solutions
- Captures successful implementation approaches
- Builds skill and technology graphs
- Provides context-aware recommendations

**Three-Layer System:**
1. **LEANN** - Vector-based semantic search
2. **Neo4j** - Knowledge graph with relationships
3. **File-based KB** - Categorized markdown entries
